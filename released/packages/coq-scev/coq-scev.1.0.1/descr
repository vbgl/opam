Scalar evolution is an algebraic theory of recurrences. It has found
use in modern compilers which use the theory to model loop variables.
This is an implementation of the scalar evolution theory in Coq. In particular,
it implements the definitions and simplification lemmas from the
original "chains of recurrences" paper.
