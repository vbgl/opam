This library provides a stand-alone proof of the Pigeonhole
principle. The Pigeonhole principle is a fundamental theorem that
is used widely in Computer Science and Combinatorics, it asserts
that if you put n things into m containers, and n > m, then at
least one of the containers contains more than one thing.
