Extensions of MSets for Efficient Execution

Coq's MSet library provides various, reasonably efficient finite set
implementations. Nevertheless, FireEye was struggling with performance
issues. This library contains extensions to Coq's MSet library that
helped the FireEye Formal Methods team (formal-methods@fireeye.com),
solve these performance issues. There are

- Fold With Abort
  efficient folding with possibility to start late and stop early

- Interval Sets
  a memory efficient representation of sets of numbers
  
- Unsorted Lists with Duplicates
