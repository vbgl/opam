Mathematical Components Library on Analysis (DRAFT)

This library contains a DRAFT and UNSTABLE embryo of an analyis
library inspired from the Coquelicot Library, but compatible with the
Mathematical Components library. It contains libraries about real
numbers, probability distributions, topology, filters, Bachmann-Landay
notations, derivative and differentiation.

This library relies on extensionality axioms (propositional and
functional extentionality) and on classical axioms (excluded middle
and a custom version of axiom of choice). These axioms are not derived
from the standard library's axioms in the current draft. Additionally
we temporarily rely on classical reals from the Coq standard library.

There is also a small number of "Admitted" theorems in this
development version.
