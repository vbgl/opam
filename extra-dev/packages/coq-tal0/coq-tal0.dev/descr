Based on the paper "Typed Assembly Language" by Greg Morrisett , TAL-0 is the design of a RISC-style typed assembly language which focuses on control-flow safety. This package provides a mechanized metatheory, particularly a machine checked proof of soundness of the TAL-0 type system as proposed by the author in section 4.2.10 of the book Advanced Topics in Types and Programming Languages.
